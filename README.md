# DISCLAIMER

To simplify copyright matters, the new sounds will be in a separate resource pack, hosted on modrinth. It will be linked here once I have it completely up and running, but it, or another resource pack designed for this version, will be required if you don't want missing/nonexistent sounds.

# Resounding Modern Warfare Cubed

This is my fork of Paneedah's, which will set the groundwork for more unique sounds to be added. If more guns are added, I'll try my best to add them to this version, and give them a full set of sounds. Keep in mind this is only a hobby project, and as such I won't be particularly fast to update it. Massive shoutout to the original Author: Vic4Games and his team for creating the original mod! And thanks to Paneedah for doing the footwork to allow simpletons like me to compile it.

# Latest Update

There's been a massive example of scope creep, and currently I have a backlog of >200 guns, a ton of attachments, and three new features: Weapon durability, weapon jamming, and system 2 iterative reloads.
