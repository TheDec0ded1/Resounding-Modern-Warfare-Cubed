# DISCLAIMER

To simplify copyright matters, the new sounds will be in a separate resource pack, hosted on modrinth. It will be linked here once I have it completely up and running, but it, or another resource pack designed for this version, will be required if you don't want missing/nonexistent sounds.

# Resounding Modern Warfare Cubed

This is my fork of Paneedah's, which will set the groundwork for more unique sounds to be added. If more guns are added, I'll try my best to add them to this version, and give them a full set of sounds. Keep in mind this is only a hobby project, and as such I won't be particularly fast to update it. Massive shoutout to the original Author: Vic4Games and his team for creating the original mod! And thanks to Paneedah for doing the footwork to allow simpletons like me to compile it.

# Latest Update

Things have gotten out of hand and the catalog of guns has been *massively* expanded from my original goals. Lots of stuff needs polish and some features are commented out for the moment while I fight bugs. 

# What's New, And What's Coming?

Weapon durability is implemented, along with a safety stop, so a 'broken' gun will just stop working, rather than breaking like a normal tool and disappearing along with all your attachments. Eventually this will be tied to a weapon jamming feature, but that's still very much in development.
Bullet impacts have been improved, and I intend to add bullet snaps/whizzes.
Specific creative inventory tabs are back, there are enough guns now to make having one creative tab completely impractical.

### How do I compile it myself?
1. Install Intellij IDEA
2. (Optional) Rename the 'Resounding-Modern-Warfare-active' Folder to RMWC to shorten the compiled file name.
3. Open Intellij IDEA, click Open Project, and select the RMWC folder.
4. Click the 'Gradle' icon on the right side of the window, then navigate to tasks/build/build.
5. Run the build task, the finished mod will be in RWMC/build/libs/.
